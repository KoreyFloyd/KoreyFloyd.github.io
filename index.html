          <p>Hellow everyone, I am excited to start this course with all of you. I work full time as a Firefighter, I have been doing that for about 6 years now. 
            When I first started class at WakeTech I was in a public saftey degree, however; I found out pretty quickly that I did not want to keep persuing towards that degree. 
            I did not have much intrest in it and felt like I wasn't taking a lot away from it. 
            I took a few years before getting back into working towards my degree, and I decided to tranfer to a Cyber Security program when I did. 
            So far this is my first class of the program and I already feel and I am going to take much more away from this program than I did from my previous one. 
            I also have many hobbies, I only listed a few below to not over crowd this page. I also listed two different websites that I use a lot for work and my hobbies. 
            I look forward to reading about everyone in this class.</p>
