# About Me
Hellow everyone, my name is Korey Floyd, I am excited to start this course with all of you. I work full time as a Firefighter, I have been doing that for about 6 years now. When I first started class at WakeTech I was in a public saftey degree, however; I found out pretty quickly that I did not want to keep persuing towards that degree. I did not have much intrest in it and felt like I wasn't taking a lot away from it. I took a few years before getting back into working towards my degree, and I decided to tranfer to a Cyber Security program when I did. So far this is my first class of the program and I already feel and I am going to take much more away from this program than I did from my previous one. I also have many hobbies, I only listed a few below to not over crowd this page. I also listed two different websites that I use a lot for work and my hobbies. I look forward to reading about everyone in this class.
## My Hobbies
* Hiking
* Fishing
* Boating
* Hunting
* Gaming
* Carpentry
* Cooking
    I have more but you get the point..
## Websites I Recommend
- [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) - I believe that Youtube is a great website for anyone who is looking into getting into a new hobby, there are endless videos for any type of hobbie and they are great for visual learners.
- [Reddit] (https://www.reddit.com) - I find Reddit to be a great website as well. You can find a lot more inforation about very specific topics than you can on other websites. Also a great website for hobbiest.
